# 📡 Navigation & Localization Accuracy – Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)  

**Goal:** To estimate theoretical limits on GPS positioning accuracy.  

**Tools:** Python, RINEX Data, CRLB Modeling  

**What I Did:**  
- Processed RINEX observation data to calculate positional accuracy.  
- Applied CRLB to analyze how satellite geometry and measurement errors affect localization.  

**Key Insight:**  
Stronger satellite geometry improves GPS precision, reducing localization error.
